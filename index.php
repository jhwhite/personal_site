        <!--<p>I am a software project manager with a love of many different technologies. I've led international teams, helped create video games, and explored how innovation works in a development studio. At work I'm dedicated to bettering the projects and companies I'm working with and I am always looking for ways to grow and improve.
          At home you can find me reading anything from science fiction to American history to self development books. Or playing European style boardgames.
          Around town you can find me trying new cuisines, finding new trails to hike, and occassionally taking a picture or two.</p>-->
